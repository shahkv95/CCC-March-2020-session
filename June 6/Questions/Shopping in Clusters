Jaime the Tailor's new customer wants to add n distinct clusters of buttons to her dress, where each cluster is filled with a distinct number of buttons of a certain color.

The customer also has specific ideas about how much she wants to pay for each cluster in that for some cluster i, she wants to pay at least ai dollars. In addition, she wants each cluster to contain a distinct number of buttons. And, finally, she wants to minimize her total cost.

Jaime stocks an infinite number of buttons in an infinite number of colors at his shop, and each button costs p dollars.
