1. Python: List of Even Integers
In this challenge, you are required to implement a function that:

is named even.

takes 2 integer arguments, start, and n.

returns a list of n smallest even integers greater than or equal to start, in ascending order.

 

Implementation of the function will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains parameters for the function call. The function will be called with those parameters, and the result of its execution will be printed to the standard output by the provided code.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ start, n ≤ 100

 

Input Format Format for Custom Testing
In the first and only line, there are two space-separated integers, start, and n.

Sample Case 0
Sample Input

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
2 4     →  start = 2, n = 4
Sample Output

2 4 6 8
Explanation

The function must return a list of the 4 smallest even integers that are greater than or equal to 2, sorted into ascending order: 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Sample Case 1
Sample Input

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
5 7     →  start = 5, n = 7
Sample Output

6 8 10 12 14 16 18
Explanation

The function must return a list of the 7 smallest even integers that are greater than or equal to 5, sorted in ascending order: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.
