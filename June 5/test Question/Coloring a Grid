4. Coloring a Grid
An automated painting system needs a program that can paint an n x 3 grid in red, green, and blue such that no row or column contains cells that are all the same color. Determine the number of valid patterns that can be painted given n rows. Since the number of patterns can be large, return the value modulo (109+7).

 

Example

n = 4

Some examples of how the colors can be arranged for 4 x 3 grid are shown below. The total number of valid patterns is 296490 for a grid with 4 rows. Samples with 2 and 3 rows are given below.

 



 

Function Description

 

Complete the countPatterns function in the editor below.

 

countPatterns has only one parameter:

    int n: the number of columns of the n x 3 grid.

Return

    int: the number of ways in which the gid can be colored, calculated as a modulo of (109+7)

 

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 20000
 

Input Format For Custom Testing
The only line of input contains an integer, n, the number of rows of the n x 3 grid.
