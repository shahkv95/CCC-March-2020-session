6. Connected Groups
Relationships between people may be represented in a matrix as a series of binary digits. For example, the direct relationships for person 0 with persons 0 through 5 might be shown as 101100.  This means that person 0 knows persons 0, 2 and 3, the indices of each of the 1 values. A relationship is transitive. In other words, if person 0 knows person 2 and person 2 knows person 3, then person 0 knows person 3 through person 2.  A group is composed of all of the people who know one another, whether directly or transitively.

 

Example

Consider the following relationships matrix:



Persons 0 and 1 are connected, while person 2 is not. There are 2 groups.

 

Determine the number of groups represented in a matrix.

 

Note: The method signatures may vary slightly depending on the requirements of the chosen language. For example, C language will have an argument that represents the number of rows and columns in the matrix. Also, Java will receive a list rather than an array.

 

Function Description

Complete the function countGroups in the editor below.

 

countGroups has the following parameter(s):

    int related[n]:  an array of strings of binary digits related[i] that represent connections of people

 

Returns:

    int: an integer that represents the number of groups of people

 

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 300
0 ≤ i < n
|related| = n
Each related[i] contains a binary string of n zeros and ones. related is a square matrix.
Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

 

The first line contains an integer n, the size of the square association matrix, related.

The next n lines each contain a binary string of length n that represents a row in the matrix, related[i] where 0 ≤ i < n.

Sample Case 0
Sample Input

STDIN     Function
-----     -----
4      →  size of related[] n = 4
1100   →  related = ['1100', '1110', '0110', '0001']
1110
0110
0001
 

Sample Output

2
 

Explanation

Squares highlighting a connection between two people are highlighted in green. Each of the people is known to self, so they are highlighted in gray.



There are n = 4 people numbered related[0] through related[3].

There are 2 pairs who directly know each another: (related[0], related[1]) and (related[1],related[2]). Because a relation is transitive, the set of people {related[0], related[1], related[2]} is considered a single group.

The remaining person, related[3], does not know any other people and is a separate group: {related[3]}.

There are a total of 2 groups.

Sample Case 1
Sample Input

STDIN     Function
-----     -----
5      →  size of related[] n = 5
10000  →  related = ['10000', '01000', '00100', '00010', '00001']
01000
00100
00010
00001
 

Sample Output

5
 

Explanation



No direct relationships are shown so there are 5 groups: {related[0]}, {related[1]}, {related[2]}, {related[3]}, and {related[4]}.
