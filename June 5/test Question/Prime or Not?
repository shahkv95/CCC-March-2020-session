2. Prime or Not?
Given an integer, if the number is prime, return 1. Otherwise return its smallest divisor greater than 1.

 

Example

n = 24 

 

The number 24 is not prime: its divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]. The smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2.

isPrime has the following parameter(s):

    long n:  a long integer to test

Returns

    int: if the number is prime, return 1; otherwise returns the smallest divisor greater than 1

 

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 1012
Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

Sample Input 0

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
2      →   n = 2
 

Sample Output 0

1
 

Explanation 0

As 2 is a prime number, the function returns 1.

 

Sample Case 1
Sample Input 1

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
4      →   n = 4
 

Sample Output 1

2
 

Explanation 1

Since 4 is not a prime number, and the factors of 4 are [1, 2, 4], the function returns the smallest factor of 4 greater than 1.
