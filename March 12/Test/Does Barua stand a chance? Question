You are stuck in a 2D maze. The maze is represented by a 2D array of integer a[n][m] where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns and a[i][j] denotes the depth of the cell at the intersection of ith row and jth column. You can only slide down, i.e. you can only go from a cell to an adjacent cell with depth less than or equal to the current cell. Also you can only travel to cells that share a side with the current cell you are standing on.

You are given the co-ordinates of the cell that you start on (Xs, Ys) and the co-ordinates of the cell you are supposed to end on (Xe, Ye) (These are the co-ordinates that Barua stands on).

Barua is waiting for you on the cell with the end co-ordinates. Do you think you have a chance to meet him?

Input Format:
First line consists of two numbers n and m, the number of rows and columns in the maze.
Second line consists of four integers Xs, Ys, Xe, Ye, the start and end co-ordinates.
Next n lines contains m integers each, the jth integer on the ith line denoting the depth of the cell a[i][j].
NOTE : You begin at (Xs,Ys) and Barua stands at (Xe,Ye).

Output Format:
Print "Hie Barua" if it is possible for you to meet him and print "No Chance" otherwise.

Input Constraints :

1 <= n,m <= 1000
1 <= Xs, Xe <= n
1 <= Ys, Ye <= m
-10^5 <= a[i][j] <= 10^5
