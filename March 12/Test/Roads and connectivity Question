You have been hired by the government for their latest project.

The country consists of N cities and M roads. Roads are directional. There may be more than one roads between some cities. The cities are numbered from 1 to N.

You are given Q queries, each query has two integers U and V.

Your task is to print the shortest path between city U and city V.

If it is not possible to go from city U to city V, then print -1.

Input
First line consists of three integers N, M and Q.
Next M lines each consists of three integers u, v, and w denoting a bidirectional road between city u and city v with length w.
Then Q lines follow, each line having two integers U and V.

Output
Print Q lines of output.
For each query print the length of the shortest path between U and V

Notes
1 ≤ N ≤ 200 1 ≤ M, Q, ≤ N × N
