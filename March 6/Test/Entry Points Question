You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points but not more than one exit (ie. entry/exit points are unidirectional doors like valves). The cells are named with an integer value from 0 to N-1. You need to find the following :

find Maximum number of entry points (incoming edges) for any cell in the maze

Note: Aim for O(N) solution.

INPUT FORMAT
First line has the number of cells N

Second line has list of N values of the edge[] array. edge[i] contains the cell number that can be reached from of cell ‘i’ in one step. edge[i] is -1 if the ‘i’th cell doesn’t have an exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Print the index of node with max entry points

Sample Input 0
