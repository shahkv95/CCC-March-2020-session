You are given an array A of size N.
You are also givena number K.
Let us define what K-Divisibility of an array means :
       K-Divisibility of an array is the number of unordered pairs (i,j) such that Ai + Aj is divisible by K.

Your task is to find and print the K-Divisibility of the given array A.

INPUT
First line contains two integers, size of array N and the value K.
Second line contains N space separated integers, ith of which denotes Ai.

OUTPUT
Print one value, the K-Divisibility of the array.

CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ N, K, Ai ≤ 106
